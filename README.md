Steps to set up Git credential manager(Windows)
================================================

Install latest version of git credential manager here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/latest

Make sure credential manager is configured by using the command:
git config credential.helper manager

You can verify that your environment is configured correctly by running 
git config --list and looking for credential.helper=manager. 
If you do not see the line, then you know that Git does not know about 
the Git Credential Manager.
